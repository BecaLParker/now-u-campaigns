# now-u app changelog

## What is a changelog?

A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of
notable changes for each version of a project.

## Why keep a changelog?

To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable
changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.

## Who needs a changelog?

People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human
beings who care about what's in the software. When the software changes, people
want to know why and how.

## How do I make a good changelog?

Make sure that you write clear and consise commit messages, so that when we write the 
changelog you can clearly see what your code is supposed to do. 

### Guiding Principles

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

### Types of changes

- `Added` for new features.  
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.  
- `Removed` for now removed features.  
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.  
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
