                    kindness and solidarity that we saw in our communities
                    during the Covid-19 lockdown. We noticed that many people
                    wanted to do something to help others during these difficult
                    times but didn&apos;t know what they could do, while at the
                    same time, charities were doing amazing work and in
                    desperate need of support.

                    working on the front lines of global issues.

                    The global lockdown has offered us an opportunity to take
                    stock of what&apos;s really important to us, and a chance to
                    move forward together instead of falling &lsquo;back to
                    normal&rsquo;. We believe that each of us has the power to
