## Welcome! :wave:

This is the official repository for the now-u Web Application. now-u is a non-profit started by James and Lizzie Elgar, aimed at driving positive change through coordinated monthly campaigns and actions. Volunteers from all over the world contributed to now-u, and are continuing to do so today, from app and web development, through designing and marketing. If you are reading this, there is a possibility you are a volunteer who has just been onboarded onto the Web Team, and if this is the case, keep on reading!

## Development :computer:

Whether you were formally onboarded onto the now-u team, or would like to contribute to some open source, now-u is extremely grateful for any input you may have, so firstly a massive THANK YOU! Although, if you are looking at contributing, please follow some code guidelines to ensure that this repository is kept clean for other contributors and volunteers. 

1. Pick an issue of your choosing from the `issues` tab on this Github repository. If there is no-one assigned to an issue, ask @JElgar or @stellenberger to assign you, or assign yourself and let us know on slack. 
2. Once you get started set it as "in-progress"
3. Make a branch (off `dev`) called either "feature/description" or "bugfix/description"
