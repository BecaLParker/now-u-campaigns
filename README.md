# now-u-campaigns

This repo is currently focused on creating a SPA to display campaigns. Its scope will eventually be the whole site.

## Setup

1. Run `npm i`
2. Run `npm start` or `npm run build`

## Notes

The homepage files are separated into both the /public and /src/domain/home folders. Eventually we can consolidate all the homepage assets into the /home folders when we migrate everything to React.
