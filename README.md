# now-u-campaigns

This repo is currently focused on creating a SPA to display campaigns. Its scope will eventually be the whole site.

## Setup

1. Run `npm i`
2. Run `npm start` or to build `npm run build`

## Notes

The homepage files are separated into both the /public and /src/domain/home folders. Eventually we can consolidate all the homepage assets into the /home folders when we migrate everything to React.

## To Dos

1. Standardize font-sizes across app
2. Add animations for hamburger menu when toggling nav
3. Possibly add an announcements bar at the top of every page which displays the latest campaign added
4. Wire up app download buttons
5. Fetch real campaign data
6. Must determine what the nav bar should look like when on /campaigns route
